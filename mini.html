        <p><strong>Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12
                March 1935)</strong>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical
            chemist.
            Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
            long-distance
            telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the
            transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").
            Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915,
            which later
            became NASA.</p>
